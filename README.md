# Iris Data Analysis and Regression Project

This repository hosts the Iris Data Analysis and Regression Project, a C++ program designed to perform statistical analysis and regression on the Iris dataset. The project demonstrates the application of basic data science techniques using C++ and a custom-built matrix library.

Key Features:
- Data parsing and preprocessing from CSV files.
- Implementation of a matrix class to handle data operations.
- Statistical analysis including sum, mean, median, variance, and standard deviation calculation for each column.
- Linear regression model to predict values based on the dataset.
- Functionality to handle outliers and improve data integrity.
- Evaluation of the model's performance using mean square error and mean absolute percentage error.

This project stands as an example of leveraging C++ for data analysis and machine learning fundamentals, showcasing my skills in programming, data manipulation, and statistical understanding.
